# Newclear

Newclear is a contamination of nuclear and reNEWable energy. Emphasis on the clean, new tech and reNEWable character of nuclear energy. Not affiliated with any political party.

## Image problem vs. #Factfulness

The nuclear industry has an image problem, that's why I suggest the rebranding to [newclear](https://twitter.com/newclea64645516)! This poster will help us pinpoint the image problem (and is very useful even besides this theme).

## Factful rules of thumb

1. **Look At the majority**: the majority of our energy is still coming from dirty, bigoily, fossil fuels. We will need all help we need to be able to change this.
2. **Expect Negative news**: with every new technology things can and will go wrong. It did already go wrong majorly for newclear energy. Because of the fear of the mistakes of older generations you can still expect to see a lot of negative news about newclear energy.
3. **Imagine bending lines*: TODO Deaths due to nuclear disaster? 
4. **Calculate the risk**: It's hard to do for mere mortals for such a complex system as newclear energy. But luckily scientist do exactly that. In one paper it's esitmated that there is [a 50% chance of some nuclear accident happening before 2050](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/536886/the-chances-of-another-chernobyl-before-2050-50-say-safety-specialists/). Luckily there is also research that can help [in preventing a actual catastrophic failure](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330943763_Natural_Hazards_and_Nuclear_Power_Plant_Safety).
5. **Is it big in comparison?**: In the past there have been several thousands of deaths attributed to nuclear disasters, but it pales in comparison with the casualities of air pollution (mainly due to burning fossil fuels) with a staggering 3 millions deaths according to the World Health Organization.
6. **How are they different?**: TODO
7. **Notice slow changes**: Newclear technology has undergone slow but dramatic and wonderful changes already. Several new promising designs are also on the horizon. Think of: Small Modular Reactors, Thorium reactors, TODO
8. **What other solutions exist*: If the current newclear reactor designs still carry too much risk, new generations (and research for that) should be supported. Other renewable technologies should also keep being deployed on a global scale. We advocate for an AND story: newclear energy AND other renewables.
9. **Resisit pointing finger**: Our entire modern society exists because of the energy revolution that the fossil fuel industry fueled. Not only Big Oil, the advertisting industry, megacorporations or governments are to blame for human caused global warming. All of us are, we're all in the same boat (Earth).
10. **Take small steps**: Very few of us could actually fund a fully functional newclear reactor. But advocacy, that, everyone can do. Convince your mom, your dad, your girlfriend(s), your teacher, your siblings, ... that we will need [#newclear](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23newclear) energy as additional renewable energy source to combat climate change.

I'd love to welcome contributions. In writing, in advocacy, and in the future maybe financially.
